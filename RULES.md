# Basics


### The Game

_Beyond Reach_ is a game about a crew of intrepid spacefarers working outside the law to their own ends. It supports high-octane action, tense negotiation, grand politicking, and small-scale character stakes set against an ever-so-slightly retro futuristic setting.

Like all Forged in the Dark games, we play to find out: find out if the crew can survive, if they can thrive, and what impact they’ll have on the Reach.


### The Setting

The game takes place in the "Reach," a star system isolated from all others. It matches no known star charts of its inhabitants, and no one has ever detected a signal from the outside. Littered throughout are powerful Precursor artifacts, magical treasures from a bygone age.

The Deep Space around the Reach is treacherous, filled with debris and lacking any settlement. It stretches on, as space tends to do, infinitely. No one has ever made it to another star system and reported back.

Next is the Gate and its corresponding Gate Station, where all inhabitants of the Reach can trace their origin. The Gate is mysterious, and in the current era one-way. Travelers from different timelines, dimensions, and realities can find themselves mired in its grasp, spit out with great force into the Reach with no way home. Gate Station is a relic of a forgotten age, designed to control and configure the behavior of the Gate. It is manned by a staff of semi-sentient robots, the only remaining native inhabitants of the Reach.

Just past the Gate is the Outskirts, a constantly shifting frontier where exiles, scoundrels, and opportunities seek their day in the light of the distant Sun. It's a hotspot for commerce, both legitimate and black-market as people, supplies, derelicts, and curiousities flow into it from the Gate.

Continuing further Sunward is the Planetary Ring, which houses the majority of the population. It contains the three terrestrial bodies of the system: Argos, a city world; Asterion, a small ice planet; and Ares, a terraformed farming planet. These planets all share an orbit with a massive Precursor artifact, which stabilizes their seemingly-impossible 4-planet orbital.

Past the habitable area is the Solar Zone, bathed in radiation and immense heat. Who knows what undiscovered mysteries could lurk in the treacherous aura of a star?

Depending on what tweaks you’d like to make to the game, the exact setup of the star system is maleable. It's important to have the star system be isolated (otherwise the player characters can simply jaunt away to another system while things cool down) and to have a large mix of aliens in the system through some interesting mechanism (to promote diversity of the possible types of characters.)

In summary: the Reach is isolated, full of a combination of technology and magic, and always in flux.


### The Players

Each player creates a character and works with the other players to create the crew to which their characters belong. Each player strives to bring their character to life as an interesting, daring scoundrel who reaches boldly beyond their current safety and means. This is the players’ core responsibility: they engage with the premise of the game, seeking out interesting opportunities for crime in the haunted city—taking big risks against powerful foes and sending their characters into danger.

The players work together with the Game Master to establish the tone and style of the game by making judgment calls about the mechanics, dice, and consequences of actions. The players take responsibility as co-authors of the game with the GM. For more, see [Players Best Practices](#players-best-practices).


### The Characters

The scoundrels are those pushed to the fringe, by circumstance or misfortune. They come from the planets, the space stations, or outside the system; they're human, alien, or synthetic; they're just here for the next score or they're dedicated to the cause. Characters all have a 'playbook,' which determines their character types.

- Assassins: Assassins deal in deliberate, targeted violence and evasion
- Bruisers: Bruisers are sturdy and dependable fighters.
- Diplomat: Diplomats are silver-tongued operatives who can convince and cajole.
- Gearhead: Gearheads are comfortable with machines, crafting, and invention.
- Pilot: Pilots are dare-devils who constantly skirt the edge of the possible.
- Medic: Medics are intellectual and effective with biological problems, both to heal and hurt. 
- Mystic: Mystics are connected to the magic energy that flows through the world.
- Slicer: Slicers understand the 'net and see the cracks in complex systems.
These types aren't specific roles in the crew, but merely initial specializations and sets of abilities. A specific class also doesn't mean you're "in charge." Who says the Pilot has to be the captain?

For more, see [Character Creation](#character-creation).


### The Crew

The characters are more than the sum of their parts, and they form the Crew (of a deadly pirate ship? an illicit space station? a planetside racket? You choose!). The crew also gets its own sheet; for more, see [Crew Creation](#crew-creation).

TODO: crew sheets


### The Game Master

The GM establishes the dynamic world around the characters. The GM plays all the non-player characters in the world by giving each one a concrete desire and preferred method of action.

The GM helps organize the conversation of the game so it’s pointed toward the interesting elements of play. The GM isn’t in charge of the story and doesn’t have to plan events ahead of time. They present interesting opportunities to the players, then follow the chain of action and consequences wherever they lead.


### Playing a Session

A session of _Beyond Reach_ is like an episode of a TV show. There are one or two main events, plus maybe some side-story elements, which all fit into an ongoing series. A session of play can last anywhere from two to six hours, depending on the preferences of the group.

During a session, the crew of scoundrels works together to choose a score to accomplish, then they make a few dice rolls to jump into the action of the score in progress. The PCs take actions, suffer consequences, and finish the operation (succeed or fail). Then the crew has downtime, during which they recover, pursue side-projects, and indulge their vices. After downtime, the players once again look for a new opportunity or create their own goals and pursuits, and we play to find out what happens next.

It can be helpful to split episodes into "seasons." Seasons group related characters, concepts, and storylines; you can determine them ahead of time ("this session starts Season 2") or retroactively ("I think we can call these last 5 sessions their own season.") There are no hard-or-fast rules here, just go with what you feel like.


### Touchstones:

_Beyond Reach_ is lightly retrofuturistic and cyberpunk, set in a magic-infused world. Public spaces should feel like a mix of various species and cultures; aliens should be strange and interesting; technology should be tacticle and just a little clunky. The magic of the Reach isn't stable or easy; it should feel intimidating and not to be used lightly.

## The Core System


### The Conversation

A roleplaying game is a conversation between the GM and the players, punctuated by dice rolls to inject uncertainty and surprising turns.

The GM presents the fictional situation in which the player characters find themselves. The players determine the actions of their characters in response to the situation. The GM and the players together judge how the game systems are engaged. The outcomes of the mechanics then change the situation, leading into a new phase of the conversation—new situations, new actions, new judgments, new rolls—creating an ongoing fiction and building "the story" of the game, organically, from a series of discrete moments.

No one is in charge of the story. The story is what happens as a result of the situation presented by the GM, the actions the characters take, the outcomes of the mechanics, and the consequences that result. The story emerges from the unpredictable collision of all of these elements. You play to find out what the story will be.


### Judgement Calls

Since roleplaying is a collaborative, expressive act, not a purely strategic endeavor, you’ll need to make judgment calls. By making these choices, the game group together establishes a style, tone, and form of fiction unique to their instance of play. _Beyond Reach_ is designed to bring these judgment calls to the forefront and make them explicit tools of the game.

When you play, you’ll make several key judgment calls. Everyone contributes, but either the players or the GM gets final say for each:

- Which actions are reasonable as a solution to a problem? _Can this person be swayed? Must we get out the tools and tinker with this old rusty lock, or could it also be quietly finessed?_ The players have final say.
- How dangerous and how effective is a given action in this circumstance? _How risky is this? Can this person be swayed very little or a whole lot?_ The GM has final say.
- Which consequences are inflicted to manifest the dangers in a given circumstance? _Does this fall from the roof break your leg? Do the guards merely become suspicious or do they already have you trapped?_ The GM has final say.
- Does this situation call for a dice roll, and which one? _Is your scoundrel in position to make an action roll or must they first make a resistance roll to gain initiative?_ The GM has final say.
- Which events in the story match the experience triggers for character and crew advancement? _Did you express your character’s beliefs, drives, origin, or background?_ You tell us. The players have final say.

### Rolling the Dice

_Beyond Reach_ uses six-sided dice. You roll several at once and read the single highest result.

- If the highest die is a 6, it’s a full success—things go well. If you roll more than one 6, it’s a critical success—you gain some additional advantage.
- If the highest die is a 4 or 5, that’s a partial success—you do what you were trying to do, but there are consequences: trouble, harm, reduced effect, etc.
- If the highest die is 1-3, it’s a bad outcome. Things go poorly. You probably don’t achieve your goal and you suffer complications, too.
If you ever need to roll but you have zero (or negative) dice, roll two dice and take the single lowest result. You can’t roll a critical when you have zero dice.

All the dice systems in the game are expressions of this basic format. When you’re first learning the game, you can always "collapse" back down to a simple roll to judge how things go. Look up the exact rule later when you have time.

The most common result is 4/5: partial success. This means that your character will tend to succeed, but at a cost—you’ll rarely get away clean. _Beyond Reach_ is a game about underdog characters who are in over their heads. The dice mechanic reinforces this by making partial success crop up again and again. This is a good thing! Trouble is where the fun of the game happens.

To create a dice pool for a roll, you’ll use a trait (like your Finesse or your Body rating or your crew’s Tier) and take dice equal to its rating. You’ll usually end up with one to four dice. Even one die is pretty good in this game—a 50% chance of success. The most common traits you’ll use are the action ratings of the player characters. A player might roll dice for their Brawl action rating when they fight an enemy, for example.

There are four types of rolls that you’ll use most often in the game:

- [Action roll.](#action-roll) When a PC attempts an action that’s dangerous or troublesome, you make an action roll to find out how it goes. Action rolls and their effects and consequences drive most of the game.
- [Downtime roll.](#downtime) When the PCs are at their leisure after a job, they can perform downtime activities in relative safety. You make downtime rolls to see how much they get done.
- [Fortune roll.](#fortune-roll) The GM can make a fortune roll to disclaim decision making and leave something up to chance. How loyal is an NPC? How much does the plague spread? How much evidence is burned before the Bluecoats kick in the door?
- [Resistance roll.](#resistance-and-armor) A player can make a resistance roll when their character suffers a consequence they don’t like. The roll tells us how much stress their character suffers to reduce the severity of a consequence. When you resist that "Broken Leg" harm, you take some stress and now it’s only a "Sprained Ankle" instead.

### The Game Structure

_Beyond Reach_ has a structure to play, with four parts. By default, the game is in **free play**—characters talk to each other, they go places, they do things, they make rolls as needed.

When the group is ready, they choose a target for their next criminal operation, then choose a type of plan to employ. This triggers the [engagement roll](#engagement-roll) (which establishes the situation as the operation starts) and then the game shifts into the score phase.

During [the score,](#the-score) the PCs engage the target—they make rolls, overcome obstacles, call for flashbacks, and complete the operation (successfully or not). When the score is finished, the game shifts into the downtime phase.

During the [downtime phase,](#downtime) the GM engages the systems for payoff, heat, and entanglements, to determine all the fallout from the score. Then the PCs each get their downtime activities, such as indulging their vice to remove stress or working on a long-term project. When all the downtime activities are complete, the game returns to free play and the cycle starts over again.

The phases are a conceptual model to help you organize the game. They’re not meant to be rigid structures that restrict your options (this is why they’re presented as amorphous blobs of ink without hard edges). Think of the phases as a menu of options to fit whatever it is you’re trying to accomplish in play. Each phase suits a different goal.


## Actions and Attributes


### Action Ratings

There are 12 actions in the game that the player characters use to overcome obstacles:

- Doctor
- Study
- Hack
- Tinker
- Finesse
- Sneak
- Brawl
- Wreck
- Attune
- Command
- Consort
- Sway
Each action has a rating (from zero to 4) that tells you how many dice to roll when you perform that action. Action ratings don’t just represent skill or training—you’re free to describe how your character performs that action based on the type of person they are. Maybe your character is good at Command because they have a scary stillness to them, while another character barks orders and intimidates people with their military bearing.

You choose which action to perform to overcome an obstacle, by describing what your character does. Actions that are poorly suited to the situation may be less effective and may put the character in more danger, but they can still be attempted. Usually, when you perform an action, you’ll make an action roll to see how it turns out.


### Rolling Actions

You make an [action roll](#action-roll) when your character does something potentially dangerous or troublesome. The possible results of the action roll depend on your character’s position. There are three positions: controlled, risky, and desperate. If you’re in a controlled position, the possible consequences are less serious. If you’re in a desperate position, the consequences can be severe. If you’re somewhere in between, it’s risky—usually considered the “default” position for most actions.

If there’s no danger or trouble at hand, you don’t make an action roll. You might make a [fortune roll](#fortune-roll) or a [downtime roll](#downtime) or the GM will simply say yes—and you accomplish your goal.


### Attribute Ratings

There are three attributes in the game system that the player characters use to resist bad consequences: Mind, Body, and Social. Each attribute has a rating (from zero to 4) that tells you how many dice to roll when you use that attribute.

The rating for each attribute is equal to the number of dots in the first column under that attribute. The more well-rounded your character is with a particular set of actions, the better their attribute rating.


### Resistance Roll

Each attribute resists a different type of danger. If you get stabbed, for example, you resist physical harm with your Body rating. [Resistance rolls](#resistance-and-armor) always succeed—you diminish or deflect the bad result—but the better your roll, the less stress it costs to reduce or avoid the danger.

When the enemy has a big advantage, you’ll need to make a resistance roll before you can take your own action. For example, when you duel the master sword- fighter, she disarms you before you can strike. You need to make a resistance roll to keep hold of your blade if you want to attack her. Or perhaps you face a powerful ghost and attempt to Attune with it to control its actions. But before you can make your own roll, you must resist possession from the spirit.

The GM judges the threat level of the enemies and uses these “preemptive” resistance rolls as needed to reflect the capabilities of especially dangerous foes.


## Stress and Trauma


### Stress

Player characters in Blades in the Dark have a special reserve of fortitude and luck called stress. When they suffer a consequence that they don’t want to accept, they can take stress instead. The result of the [resistance roll](#resistance-and-armor) determines how much stress it costs to avoid a bad outcome.

_During a knife fight, Daniel’s character, Cross, gets stabbed in the chest. Daniel rolls his Body rating to resist, and gets a 2. It costs 6 stress, minus 2 (the result of the resistance roll) to resist the consequences. Daniel marks off 4 stress and describes how Cross survives._

_The GM rules that the harm is reduced by the resistance roll, but not avoided entirely. Cross suffers level 2 harm (“Chest Wound”) instead of level 3 harm (“Punctured Lung”)._


### Pushing Yourself

You can use stress to push yourself for greater performance. For each bonus you choose below, take 2 stress (each can be chosen once for a given action):

- Add +1d to your roll. (This may be used for an action roll or downtime roll or any other kind of roll where extra effort would help you)
- Add +1 level to your [effect.](#effect)
- Take action when you’re [incapacitated.](#consequences)
The ability to push yourself for +1d means you effectively have at least 1d in every action as long as you have stress to burn. Even 1d gives you a 50/50 chance of success. This is the core “scoundrel’s luck” in the game system. Even when you’re in a bad spot, trying to do something for which you have no experience or training, you can dig deep and give yourself a chance. (A much better chance than rolling 2d and taking the lowest when you have zero dots.)

It’s important to remember this! Some players tend to forget and dismiss actions for which they have zero dots. “Nah, I can’t do that. I don’t have Attune. I’d have to roll 2d and take the worst. Ugh.” As long as you have stress to burn, you can get 1d and give any action a decent shot.


### Trauma

When a PC marks their last stress box, they suffer a level of trauma. When you take trauma, circle one of your trauma conditions like Cold, Reckless, Unstable, etc. They’re all described in the next section.

When you suffer trauma, you’re taken out of action. You’re “left for dead” or otherwise dropped out of the current conflict, only to come back later, shaken and drained. When you return, you have zero stress and your [vice](#vice) has been satisfied for the next downtime.

Trauma conditions are permanent. Your character acquires the new personality quirk indicated by the condition, and can earn xp by using it to cause trouble. When you mark your fourth trauma condition, your character cannot continue as a daring scoundrel. You must [retire them](#retirement) to a different life or [send them to prison](#incarceration) to take the fall for the crew’s Wanted Level.


### Trauma Conditions

- Cold: You’re not moved by emotional appeals or social bonds.
- Haunted: You’re often lost in reverie, reliving past horrors, seeing things.
- Obsessed: You’re enthralled by one thing: an activity, a person, an ideology.
- Paranoid: You imagine danger everywhere; you can’t trust others.
- Reckless: You have little regard for your own safety or best interests.
- Soft: You lose your edge; you become sentimental, passive, gentle.
- Unstable:Youremotionalstateisvolatile.Youcaninstantlyrage,orfallinto despair, act impulsively, or freeze up.
- Vicious: You seek out opportunities to hurt people, even for no good reason.
You can play your trauma conditions as much or as little as you like. They can totally transform your character’s persona or have only a small impact—it’s up to you. If you do play them strongly, though, allowing a trauma condition to complicate your character’s life, you [earn xp for it.](#advancement)


### Stress and the Supernatural

Precursor artifacts and magical abilities can summon ancient horrors, such as Shades or Demons. These apparitions, if not properly prepared for, can totally disable a person with terror. A PC can resist this Socially, risking stress to act in the face of danger. The terror of the unknown is not the only danger; a truly powerful entity might inflict harms simply by its presence. Use this sparingly, but it can imbue a foe with a great deal of power.


## Progress Clocks

A progress clock is a circle divided into segments (see examples at right). Draw a progress clock when you need to track ongoing effort against an obstacle or the approach of impending trouble.

_Sneaking into a restricted area? Make a clock to track the alert level of the patrolling guards. When the PCs suffer consequences from partial successes or missed rolls, fill in segments on the clock until the alarm is raised._

Generally, the more complex the problem, the more segments in the progress clock.

A complex obstacle is a 4-segment clock. A more complicated obstacle is a 6-clock. A daunting obstacle is an 8-segment clock.

The effect level of an action or circumstance is used to tick segments on a clock (see [Effect](#effect)). It’s the GM’s job to tick a clock so it reflects the fictional situation. If the PCs are making a lot of progress, the clock should be ticked a lot. This comes with practice, by properly judging effect levels. But you should always feel free to adjust a clock in play to better reflect the situation.

You can’t usually fill a clock with the effect of a single action. This is by design. If a situation is simple enough for one action, don’t make a clock, just judge the outcome based on the effect level of the action.

When you create a clock, make it about the obstacle, not the method. The clocks for an infiltration should be “Interior Patrols” and “The Tower,” not “Sneak Past the Guards” or “Climb the Tower.” The patrols and the tower are the obstacles— the PCs can attempt to overcome them in a variety of ways.

Complex enemy threats can be broken into several “layers,” each with its own progress clock. For example, the Lampblacks’ HQ might have a “Perimeter Security” clock, an “Interior Guards” clock, and a “Bazso’s Office Security” clock. The crew would have to make their way through all three layers to reach Bazso’s personal safe and the whiskey collection within.

Remember that a clock tracks progress. It reflects the fictional situation, so the group can gauge how they’re doing. A clock is like a speedometer in a car. It shows the speed of the vehicle—it doesn’t determine the speed.

**Simple Obstacles**

Not every situation and obstacle requires a clock. Use clocks when a situation is complex or layered and you need to track something over time—otherwise, resolve the result of an action with a single roll.

Examples of progress clocks follow. This is not an exhaustive list. Use them as you see fit!

**Danger Clocks**

The GM can use a clock to represent a progressive danger, like suspicion growing during a seduction, the proximity of pursuers in a chase, or the alert level of guards on patrol. In this case, when a complication occurs, the GM ticks one, two, or three segments on the clock, depending on the consequence level. When the clock is full, the danger comes to fruition—the guards hunt down the intruders, activate an alarm, release the hounds, etc.

**Racing Clocks**

Create two opposed clocks to represent a race. The PCs might have a progress clock called “Escape” while the Bluecoats have a clock called “Cornered.” If the PCs finish their clock before the Bluecoats fill theirs, they get away. Otherwise, they’re cornered and can’t flee. If both complete at the same time, the PCs escape to their lair, but the hunting Bluecoats are outside!

You can also use racing clocks for an environmental hazard. Maybe the PCs are trying to complete the “Search” clock to find the lockbox on the sinking ship before the GM fills the “Sunk” clock and the vessel goes down.

**Linked Clocks**

You can make a clock that unlocks another clock once it’s filled. For example, the GM might make a linked clock called “Trapped” after an “Alert” clock fills up. When you fight a veteran warrior, she might have a clock for her “Defense” and then a linked clock for “Vulnerable.” Once you overcome the “Defense” clock, then you can attempt to overcome the “Vulnerable” clock and defeat her. You might affect the “Defense” clock with violence in a knife-fight, or you lower her defense with deception if you have the opportunity. As always, the method of action is up to the players and the details of the fiction at hand.

**Mission Clocks**

The GM can make a clock for a time-sensitive mission, to represent the window of opportunity you have to complete it. If the countdown runs out, the mission is scrubbed or changes—the target escapes, the household wakes up for the day, etc.

**Tug-of-War Clocks**

You can make a clock that can be filled and emptied by events, to represent a back-and-forth situation. You might make a “Revolution!” clock that indicates when the refugee Skovlanders start to riot over poor treatment in Doskvol. Some events will tick the clock up and some will tick it down. Once it fills, the revolution begins. A tug-of-war clock is also perfect for an ongoing turf war between two crews or factions.

**Long-Term Projects**

Some projects will take a long time. A basic long-term project (like tinkering up a new feature for a device) is eight segments. Truly long-term projects (like creating a new designer drug) can be two, three, or even four clocks, representing all the phases of development, testing, and final completion. Add or subtract clocks depending on the details of the situation and complexity of the project.

A long-term project is a good catch-all for dealing with any unusual player goal, including things that circumvent or change elements of the mechanics or the setting. For example, by default in the game, trauma is permanent. But maybe a player wants to work on a project where they create a device to draw traumatic spirit- energies into the ghost field, thus reducing a character’s trauma and unleashing a storm of enraged ghosts in the area. It will be a long and dangerous process to set up everything needed to begin and work on a project like this, but almost anything can be attempted as long as the group is interested and it seems feasible to everyone.

**Faction Clocks**

Each faction has a long-term goal (see the [faction write-ups](#factions)). When the PCs have [downtime](#downtime), the GM ticks forward the faction clocks that they’re interested in. In this way, the world around the PCs is dynamic and things happen that they’re not directly connected to, changing the overall situation in the city and creating new opportunities and challenges.

The PCs may also directly affect NPC faction clocks, based on the missions and scores they pull off. Discuss known faction projects that they might aid or interfere with, and also consider how a PC operation might affect the NPC clocks, whether the players intended it or not.


## Action Roll

When a player character does something challenging, we make an action roll to see how it turns out. An action is challenging if there’s an obstacle to the PC’s goal that’s dangerous or troublesome in some way. We don’t make an action roll unless the PC is put to the test. If their action is something that we’d expect them to simply accomplish, then we don’t make an action roll.

Each game group will have their own ideas about what “challenging” means. This is good! It’s something that establishes the tone and style of your Blades series.

To make an action roll, we go through six steps. In play, they flow together somewhat, but let’s break each one down here for clarity.

1. The player states their goal for the action.

2. The player chooses the action raing.

3. The GM sets the position for the roll.

4. The GM sets the effect level for the action.

5. Add bonus dice.

6. The player rolls the dice and we judge the result.

**1. The Player States Their Goal**

Your goal is the concrete outcome your character will achieve when they overcome the obstacle at hand. Maybe your goal is “I want to get into the manor house” or it might be “I want to see who comes and goes at the house.” In both cases, the obstacle is “the house guard patrol.” The guards are the challenging obstacle that may be dangerous or troublesome for the PC.

Usually the character’s goal is pretty obvious in context, but it’s the GM’s job to ask and clarify the goal when necessary.

_“You’re punching him in the face, right? Okay... what do want to get out of this? Do you want to take him out, or just rough him up so he’ll do what you want?”_

**2. The Player Chooses the Action Rating**

The player chooses which action rating to roll, following from what their character is doing on-screen. If you want to roll your Brawl action, then get in a fight. If you want to roll your Command action, then order someone around. You can’t roll a given action rating unless your character is presently performing that action in the fiction.

There’s definitely some gray area here, where actions overlap and goals can be attempted with a variety of approaches. This is by design. If your goal is to hurt someone with violence, you might Brawl or Sneak or or Finesse or Wreck, depending on the situation at hand. If your goal is to dismay and frighten an enemy, you might Command or Sway or Wreck. It’s the player’s choice.

**3. The GM Sets the Position**

Once the player chooses their action, the GM sets the position for the roll. The position represents how dangerous or troublesome the action might be. There are three positions: controlled, risky, and desperate. To choose a position, the GM looks at the profiles for the positions below and picks one that most closely matches the situation at hand.

- Controlled: _You have a golden opportunity. You’re exploiting a dominant advantage. You’re set up for success._
- Risky: _You go head to head. You’re acting under duress. You’re taking a chance_
- Desparate: _You’re in serious trouble. You’re overreaching your capabilities. You’re attempting a dangerous maneuver_
**By default, an action roll is risky.** You wouldn’t be rolling if there was no risk involved. If the situation seems more dangerous, make it desperate. If it seems less dangerous, make it controlled.controlled.

If you’re ever unsure about which position to pick, ask the other players. As a player, if you’re angling for a particular position, ask the GM what you might do to get it, or ask them to clarify the situation to explain their choice.

**4. The GM Sets the Effect Level**

The GM assesses the likely effect level of this action, given the factors of the situation. Essentially, the effect level tells us “how much” this action can accomplish: will it have limited, standard, or great effect? Effect level is explained in detail in the next section.

The GM’s choices for effect level and position can be strongly influenced by the player’s choice of action rating. If a player wants to try to make a new friend by Wrecking something—well... maybe that’s possible, but the GM wouldn’t be crazy to say it’s a desperate roll and probably limited effect. Seems like Consorting would be a lot better for that. The players are always free to choose the action they perform, but that doesn’t mean all actions should be equally risky or potent.

**5. Add Bonus Dice**

You can normally get two bonus dice for your action roll (some special abilities might give you additional bonus dice).

For one bonus die, you can get assistance from a teammate. They take stress depending on your relationship, say how they help you, and give you +1d. See [Teamwork](#teamwork)

For another bonus die, you can either push yourself (take 2 stress) or you can accept a Devil’s Bargain (you can’t get dice for both, it’s one or the other).

**The Devil's Bargain**

PCs in Blades are reckless scoundrels addicted to destructive vices—they don’t always act in their own best interests. To reflect this, the GM or any other player can offer you a bonus die if you accept a Devil’s Bargain. Common Devil’s Bargains include:

- Collateral damage, unintended harm.
- Sacrifice coin or an item.
- Betray a friend or loved one.
- Offend or anger a faction.
- Start and/or tick a troublesome clock.
- Add heat to the crew from evidence or witnesses.
- Suffer harm.
The Devil’s Bargain occurs regardless of the outcome of the roll. You make the deal, pay the price, and get the bonus die. 

The Devil’s Bargain is always a free choice. If you don’t like one, just reject it (or suggest how to alter it so you might consider taking it). You can always just push yourself for that bonus die instead.

If it’s ever needed, the GM has final say over which Devil’s Bargains are valid.

**Roll the Dice and Judge the Result**

Once the goal, action rating, position, and effect have been established, add any bonus dice and roll the dice pool to determine the outcome. (See the sets of possible outcomes, by position, on the next page.)

The action roll does a lot of work for you. It tells you how well the character performs as well as how serious the consequences are for them. They might succeed at their action without any consequences (on a 6), or they might succeed but suffer consequences (on a 4/5), or it might just all go wrong (on a 1-3).

On a 1-3, it’s up to the GM to decide if the PC’s action has any effect or not, or if it even happens at all. Usually, the action just fails completely, but in some circumstances, it might make sense or be more interesting for the action o have some effect even on a 1-3 result.

Each 4/5 and 1-3 outcome lists suggested consequences for the character. The worse your position, the worse the consequences are. The GM can inflict one or more of these [consequences](#consequences-and-harm), depending on the circumstances of the action roll. PCs have the ability to avoid or reduce the severity of consequences that they suffer by [resisting them.](#resistance-rolls)

When you narrate the action after the roll, the GM and player collaborate together to say what happens on-screen. _Tell us how you vault across to the other rooftop. Tell us what you say to the Inspector to convince her. The GM will tell us how she reacts. When you face the Red Sash duelist, what’s your fighting style like? Etc._

**Summary**

- A player or a GM calls for a roll. Make an action roll when the character performs a dangerous or troublesome action.
- The player chooses the action rating to roll. Choose the action that matches what the character is doing in the fiction.
- The GM establishes the position and effect level of the action. The choice of position and effect is influenced strongly by the player’s choice of action.
- dd up to two bonus dice. 1) Assistance from a teammate. 2) Push yourself (take 2 stress) or accept a Devil’s Bargain.
- Roll the dice pool and judge the outcome. The players and GM narrate the action together. The GM has final say over what happens and inflicts consequences as called for by the position and the result of the roll.
Roll results:

- Critical: You do it with increased effect.
- 6: You do it.
- 4/5:
    - Controlled: You hesitate. Withdraw and try a different approach, or else do it with a minor consequence: a minor complication occurs, you have reduced effect, you suffer lesser harm, you end up in a risky position.
    - Risky: You do it, but there’s a consequence: you suffer harm, a complication occurs, you have reduced effect, you end up in a desperate position.
    - Desparate: You do it, but there’s a consequence: you suffer severe harm, a serious complication occurs, you have reduced effect.
- 1/3:
    - Controlled: You falter. Press on by seizing a risky opportunity, or withdraw and try a different approach.
    - Risky: Things go badly. You suffer harm, a complication occurs, you end up in a desperate position, you lose this opportunity.
    - Desparate: It’s the worst outcome. You suffer severe harm, a serious complication occurs, you lose this opportunity for action.
**Double-Duty Rolls**

Since NPCs don’t roll for their actions, an action roll does double-duty: it resolves the action of the PC as well as any NPCs that are involved. The single roll tells us how those actions interact and which consequences result. On a 6, the PC wins and has their effect. On a 4/5, it’s a mix—both the PC and the NPC have their effect. On a 1-3, the NPC wins and has their effect as a consequence on the PC.


## Effect

In _Blades in the Dark_, you achieve goals by taking actions and facing consequences. But how many actions does it take to achieve a particular goal? That depends on the effect level of your actions. The GM judges the effect level using the profiles below. Which one best matches the action at hand—**great**, **standard**, or **limited**? Each effect level indicates the questions that should be answered for that effect, as well as how many segments to tick if you’re using a progress clock.

- Great (3): You achieve more than usual. How does the extra effort manifest? What additional benefit do you enjoy?
- Standard (2): You achieve what we’d expect as “normal” with this action. Is that enough, or is there more left to do?
- Limited (1): You achieve a partial or weak effect. How is your impact diminished? What effort remains to achieve your goal?

### Assessing Factors

To assess effect level, first start with your gut feeling, given this situation. Then, if needed, assess three factors that may modify the effect level: **potency**, **scale**, and **quality**. If the PC has an advantage in a given factor, consider a higher effect level. If they have a disadvantage, consider a reduced effect level.

**Potency**

The potency factor considers particular weaknesses, taking extra time or a bigger risk, or the influence of arcane powers. The electrical discharge of a lightning hook is potent against a ghost. The supernatural powers of a ghost are potent against a human. An infiltrator is more potent if all the lights are extinguished and they move about in the dark.

**Scale**

Scale represents the number of opponents, size of an area covered, scope of influence, etc. Larger scale can be an advantage or disadvantage depending on the situation. In battle, more people are better. When infiltrating, more people are a hindrance.

**Quality**

Quality represents the effectiveness of tools, weapons, or other resources, usually summarized by Tier. Fine items count as +1 bonus in quality, stacking with Tier.

_Arlyn is picking the lock to a safehouse run by the Circle of Flame. Her crew is Tier I and she has fine lockpicks—so she’s effectively Tier II. The Circle are Tier III. Arlyn is outclassed in quality, so her effect will be limited on the lock._

When considering factors, effect level might be reduced below limited, resulting in zero effect—or increased beyond great, resulting in an extreme effect.

If a PC special ability gives “+1 effect,” it comes into play after the GM has assessed the effect level. For example, if you ended up with zero effect, the +1 effect bonus from your Cutter’s Bodyguard ability would bump them up to limited effect.

Also, remember that a PC can push themselves (take 2 stress) to get +1 effect on their action. See [Pushing Yourself](#pushing-yourself)

For a master table of factor examples, see [Magnitude](#magnitude). Every factor won’t always apply to every situation. You don’t have to do an exact accounting every time, either. Use the factors to help you make a stronger judgment call— don’t feel beholden to them.


### Dominant Factors

If one effect factor overshadows the others, the side with that advantage dominates the situation. It doesn’t matter if you have a fine sword and extra effect if you try to fight 20 people at once. Their scale dominates the battle and you’re left with very limited effect, or no effect at all. The same principle applies to “impossible” actions.

_Una wants to tear down a stone guard tower that the Silver Nails are using as a lair. She says, “I take my sledgehammer over there and I Wreck the thing, smashing it down stone by stone. Ha! I rolled a crit! Great effect!” Obviously, this isn’t possible. A person can’t smash down a stone tower with a sledgehammer. We know it’s inherently silly, like jumping over the moon. But this is also codified in the effect factors. The tower is dominant in quality, scale, and potency. Unless those factors are countered somehow, Una’s effect level is zero before she starts. No matter what she rolls for her action, she’ll have no effect. This concept is useful when assessing other very tough (but achievable) situations._

_Let’s imagine instead that Una is facing a demon. She wants to Skirmish with it, by engaging it with her sword and dagger. This is similar to knocking down the tower with the sledgehammer. Even on a critical, the GM says, “You manage to land a solid blow against the creature’s skull, but there’s no wound and your hand throbs with the impact of steel against its scaly hide.” In other words, zero effect! (On a 1-3, the GM might say, “The creature swats your sword aside, clutches you in its hideous grip, and breaks your spine in two.” Seriously. Don’t mess with demons.)_

_But this situation isn’t entirely hopeless. There must be some way to battle a demon. This is where effect factors can help make sense of the situation. If the demon is dominant in quality, scale, and potency, then the PCs can try to understand the factors, and take actions to address them. What’s the demon vulnerable to? They can use that to remove its potency (and seize that advantage for themselves). What scale is it? They need to bring more troops. Etc._

_Effect factors are a way to codify the situation into a few key factors so it’s easier to talk about what needs to change in order to have the desired effect._


### Trading Position for Effect

After factors are considered and the GM has announced the effect level, a player might want to trade position for effect, or vice versa. For instance, if they’re going to make a risky roll with standard effect (the most common scenario, generally), they might instead want to push their luck and make a desperate roll but with great effect.

This kind of trade-off isn’t included in the effect factors because it’s not an element the GM should assess when setting the effect level. Once the level is set, though, you can always offer the trade-off to the player if it makes sense in the situation.

_“I Sneak across the courtyard and vault over the wall, hiding in the shadows by the canal dock and Lyssa’s gondola.”_

_“I don’t think you can make it across in one quick dash. The scale of the courtyard is a factor here, so your effect will be limited. Let’s say you can get halfway across with this action, then you’ll have to Sneak through the other half of the space (and the rest of the guards there) to reach the other side.”_

_“I didn’t realize it was that far. Hmmm. Okay, what if I just go as fast as I can. Can I get all the way across if I make a desperate roll?”_

_“Yep, sounds good to me!”_


### Effects in the Fiction

Effects aren’t simply a matter of a level name or ticking clock segments. After the action roll, when you narrate the outcome, answer the effect questions by describing what happens “on screen.” The answers to the questions will tell the group what the new situation is like, creating a natural bridge to further actions.

For a simple action, the effect level determines the end result. Do you achieve your goal partially, fully, or with great effect? For a more complex obstacle, the GM creates a progress clock to track the effort made to overcome it. You tick a number of segments on the clock depending on the effect level of your action and the factors involved. When you fill the clock, the obstacle is overcome. See [Progress Clocks](#progress-clocks)


### Consequences

When a PC suffers an effect from an enemy or a dangerous situation, it’s called a consequence. Consequences are the companion to effects. PCs have effect on the world around them and they suffer consequences in return from the risks they face. See [Consequences and Harm](#consequences-and-harm) for more.


## Setting Position and Effect

The GM sets position and effect for an action roll at the same time, after the player says what they’re doing and chooses their action. Usually, Risky / Standard is the default combination, modified by the action being used, the strength of the opposition, and the effect factors.

When you first start learning the game, you might step through the process with some deliberation, but after a bit of practice, you’ll be able to set position and effect with a quick “gut feeling” that can then be tweaked if a PC has a particular ability or item or some other element to consider as a special case.

The ability to set position and effect as independent variables gives you nine combinations to choose from, to help you convey a wide array of fictional circumstances.

_For example, if a scoundrel is facing off alone against a small enemy gang, the situation might be:_

- _She fights the gang straight up, rushing into their midst, hacking away in a wild Skirmish. In this case, being threatened by the larger force lowers her position to indicate greater risk, and the scale of the gang reduces her effect (Desperate / Limited)._
- _She fights the gang from a choke-point, like a narrow alleyway where their numbers can’t overwhelm her at once. She’s not threatened by several at once, so her risk is similar to a one-on-one fight, but there’s still a lot of enemies to deal with, so her effect is reduced (Risky / Limited)._
- _She doesn’t fight the gang, instead trying to maneuver her way past them and escape. She’s still under threat from many enemy attacks, so her position is worse, but if the ground is open and the gang can’t easily corral her, then her effect for escaping isn’t reduced (Desperate / Standard). If she had some immediate means of escape (like leaping onto a speeding carriage), then her effect might even be increased (Desperate / Great)._
- _The gang isn’t aware of her yet—she’s set up in a sniper position on a nearby roof. She takes a shot against one of them. Their greater numbers aren’t a factor, so her effect isn’t reduced, and she’s not immediately in any danger (Controlled / Great). Maybe instead she wants to fire off a salvo of suppressing fire against the whole gang, in which case their scale applies (Controlled / Limited). If the gang is on guard for potential trouble, her position is more dangerous (Risky / Great). If the gang is alerted to a sniper, then the effect may be reduced further, as they scatter and take cover (Risky / Limited). If the gang is able to muster covering fire while they fall back to a safe position, then things are even worse for our scoundrel (Desperate / Limited)._

## Consequences and Harm

Enemy actions, bad circumstances, or the outcome of a roll can inflict consequences on a PC. There are five types:

- Reduced Effect
- Complication
- Lost Opportunity
- Worse Position
- Harm
A given circumstance might result in one or more consequences, depending on the situation. The GM determines the consequences, following from the fiction and the style and tone established by the game group.

**Reduced Effect**

This consequence represents impaired performance. The PC’s action isn’t as effective as they’d anticipated. You hit him, but it’s only a flesh wound. She accepts the forged invitation, but she’ll keep her eye on you throughout the night. You’re able to scale the wall, but it’s slow going—you’re only halfway up. This consequence essentially reduces the effect level of the PC’s action by one after all other factors are accounted for.

**Complication**

This consequence represents trouble, mounting danger, or a new threat. The GM might introduce an immediate problem that results from the action right now: the room catches fire, you’re disarmed, the crew takes +1 heat from evidence or witnesses, you lose status with a faction, the target evades you and now it’s a chase, reinforcements arrive, etc.

Or the GM might tick a clock for the complication, instead. Maybe there’s a clock for the alert level of the guards at the manor. Or maybe the GM creates a new clock for the suspicion of the noble guests at the masquerade party and ticks it. Fill one tick on a clock for a minor complication or two ticks for a standard complication.

A serious complication is more severe: reinforcements surround and trap you, the room catches fire and falling ceiling beams block the door, your weapon is broken, the crew suffers +2 heat, your target escapes out of sight, etc. Fill three ticks on a clock for a serious complication.

Don’t inflict a complication that negates a successful roll. If a PC tries to corner an enemy and gets a 4/5, don’t say that the enemy escapes. The player’s roll succeeded, so the enemy is cornered... maybe the PC has to wrestle them into position and during the scuffle the enemy grabs their gun.

**Lost Opportunity**

This consequence represents shifting circumstance. You had an opportunity to achieve your goal with this action, but it slips away. To try again, you need a new approach—usually a new form of action or a change in circumstances. Maybe you tried to Brawl with the noble to trap her on the balcony, but she evades your maneuver and leaps out of reach. If you want to trap her now you’ll have to try another way—maybe by Swaying her with your roguish charm.

**Worse Position**

This consequence represents losing control of the situation—the action carries you into a more dangerous position. Perhaps you make the leap across to the next rooftop, only to end up dangling by your fingertips. You haven’t failed, but you haven’t succeeded yet, either. You can try again, re-rolling at the new, worse position. This is a good consequence to choose to show escalating action. A situation might go from controlled, to risky, to desperate as the action plays out and the PC gets deeper and deeper in trouble.

**Harm**

This consequence represents a long-lasting debility (or death). When you suffer harm, record the specific injury on your character sheet equal to the level of harm you suffer. If you suffer lesser harm, record it in the bottom row. If you suffer moderate harm, write it in the middle row. If you suffer severe harm, record it in the top row.

Your character suffers the penalty indicated at the end of the row if any or all harm recorded in that row applies to the situation at hand. So, if you have “Drained” and “Battered” harm in the bottom row, you’ll suffer reduced effect when you try to run away from the Bluecoats. When you’re impaired by harm in the top row (severe harm, level 3), your character is incapacitated and can’t do anything unless you have help from someone else or push yourself to perform the action.

If you need to mark a harm level, but the row is already filled, the harm moves up to the next row above. So, if you suffered standard harm (level 2) but had no empty spaces in the second row, you’d have to record severe harm (level 3), instead. If you run out of spaces on the top row and need to mark harm there, your character suffers a catastrophic, permanent consequence (loss of a limb, sudden death, etc., depending on the circumstances).

_Examples_:

- Fatal (4): Electrocuted, Drowned, Stabbed in the Heart.
- Severe (3): Impaled, Broken Leg, Shot in Chest, Badly Burned, Terrified.
- Moderate (2): Exhausted, Deep Cut to Arm, Concussion, Panicked, Seduced.
- Lesser (1): Battered, Drained, Distracted, Scared, Confused.
Harm like “Drained” or “Exhausted” can be a good fallback consequence if there’s nothing else threatening a PC (like when they spend all night Studying those old books, looking for any clues to Lord Scurlock’s weaknesses before he strikes).


## Resistance and Armor

When your PC suffers a consequence that you don’t like, you can choose to resist it. Just tell the GM, “No, I don’t think so. I’m resisting that.” Resistance is always automatically effective—the GM will tell you if the consequence is reduced in severity or if you avoid it entirely. Then, you’ll make a resistance roll to see how much stress your character suffers as a result of their resistance.

You make the roll using one of your character’s attributes (Insight, Prowess, or Resolve). The GM chooses the attribute, based on the nature of consequences:

- Insight: Consequences from deception or understanding.
- Prowess: Consequences from physical strain or injury.
- Resolve: Consequences from mental strain or willpower.
Your character suffers 6 stress when they resist, minus the highest die result from the resistance roll. So, if you rolled a 4, you’d suffer 2 stress. If you rolled a 6, you’d suffer zero stress. If you get a critical result, you also clear 1 stress.

_Ian’s character, Silas, is in a desperate Skirmish with several Red Sash duelists and one of them lands a blow with their sword. Since the position was desperate, the GM inflicts severe harm (modified by any other factors). They tell Ian to record level 3 harm, “Gut Stabbed” on Silas’s sheet. Ian decides to resist the harm, instead. The GM says he can reduce the harm by one level if he resists it. Ian rolls 3d for Silas’s Prowess attribute and gets a 5. Silas takes 1 stress and the harm is reduced to level 2, “Cut to the Ribs.”_

Usually, a resistance roll reduces the severity of a consequence. If you’re going to suffer fatal harm, for example, a resistance roll would reduce the harm to severe, instead. Or if you got a complication when you were sneaking into the manor house, and the GM was going to mark three ticks on the “Alert” clock, she’d only mark two (or maybe one) if you resisted the complication.

You may only roll against a given consequence once.

The GM also has the option to rule that your character completely avoids the consequence. For instance, maybe you’re in a sword fight and the consequence is getting disarmed. When you resist, the GM says that you avoid that consequence completely: you keep hold of your weapon.

By adjusting which consequences are reduced vs. which are avoided, the GM establishes the overall tone of your game. For a more daring game, most consequences will be avoided. For a grittier game, most consequences will only be reduced with resistance.

The GM may also threaten several consequences at once, then the player may choose which ones to resist (and make rolls for each).

_“She stabs you and then leaps off the balcony. Level 2 harm and you lose the opportunity to catch her with fighting.”_

_“I’ll resist losing the opportunity by grappling her as she attacks. She can stab me, but I don’t want to let her escape.”_

Once you decide to resist a consequence and roll, you suffer the stress indicated. You can’t roll first and see how much stress you’ll take, then decide whether or not to resist.

**Armor**

If you have a type of armor that applies to the situation, you can mark an armor box to reduce or avoid a consequence, instead of rolling to resist.

_Silas is taking level 2 harm, “Cut to the Ribs,” and the fight isn’t even over yet, so Ian decides to use Silas’s armor to reduce the harm. He marks the armor box and the harm becomes level 1, “Bruised.” If Silas was wearing heavy armor, he could mark a second armor box and reduce the harm again, to zero._

When an armor box is marked, it can’t be used again until it’s restored. All of your armor is restored when you choose your load for the next score. See [Loadout](#loadout).

**Death**

There are a couple ways for a PC to die:

- If they suffer level 4 fatal harm and they don’t resist it, they die. Sometimes this is a choice a player wants to make, because they feel like it wouldn’t make sense for the character to survive or it seems right for their character to die here.
- If they need to record harm at level 3 and it’s already filled, they suffer a catastrophic consequence, which might mean sudden death (depending on the circumstances).
When your character dies, you can create a new scoundrel to play. Maybe you “promote” one of the NPC gang members to a PC, or create a brand new character who joins the crew.


## Fortune Roll

The fortune roll is a tool the GM can use to disclaim decision making. You use a fortune roll in two different ways:

When you need to make a determination about a situation the PCs aren’t directly involved in and don’t want to simply decide the outcome.

_Two rival gands are fighting. How does that turn out? The GM makes a fortune roll for each of them. One gets a good result but the other gets limited effect. The GM decides that the first gang takes over some of their rivals’ turf but suffer some injuries during the skirmish._

When an outcome is uncertain, but no other roll applies to the situation at hand.

_While pilfering the workshop of an alchemist, Nock is possessed by a vengeful ghost. As control of his body slips away, Nock grabs a random potion bottle and drinks it down. Will the arcane concoction have an effect on the spirit? Will it poison Nock to death? Who knows? The GM makes a fortune roll to see how it turns out._

When you make a fortune roll you may assess any trait rating to determine the dice pool of the roll.

- When a faction takes an action with uncertain outcome, you might use their Tier rating to make a fortune roll.
- When a gang operates independently, use their quality rating for a fortune roll.
- When a supernatural power manifests with uncertain results, you might use
its magnitude for a fortune roll.

- When a PC gathers information, you might make a fortune roll using their action rating to determine the amount of the info they get.
If no trait applies, roll 1d for sheer luck or create a dice pool (from one to four) based on the situation at hand. If two parties are directly opposed, make a fortune roll for each side to see how they do, then assess the outcome of the situation by comparing their performance levels.

The fortune roll is also a good tool to help the GM manage all the various moving parts of the star system. Sometimes a quick roll is enough to answer a question or inspire an idea for what might happen next.

Other examples of fortune rolls:

- The PCs instigate a war between two factions, then sit back and watch the fireworks. How does it turn out? Does either side dominate? Are they both made vulnerable by the conflict? Make a few fortune rolls to find out.
- A strange sickness is sweeping the Outskrits. How badly is a given station hit by the outbreak? The GM assigns a magnitude to the arcane plague, and makes a fortune roll to judge the extent of its contamination.
- The Assassin stakes out a good spot and makes a sniper shot against the target when he enters his office. The controlled Sneak roll is a success, but is great effect enough to kill instantly? Instead of making a progress clock for the target’s death, the GM decides to use a simple fortune roll with his “toughness” as a trait to see if he can possibly survive the attack. The roll is a 4/5: the bullet misses his heart, but hits him in the lung—it’s a mortal wound. He’s on death’s door, with only hours to live, unless his allies can get an expert Medic to him in time.
- Inspectors are putting a case together against the PC crew. How quickly will their evidence result in arrests? The crew’s wanted level counts as a major advantage for the inspectors.
- The PCs face off in a skirmish with a veteran leviathan hunter captain and her crew. The tide of battle goes in the PCs’ favor, and many crew members are killed. One of the players asks if the captain will surrender to spare the rest of her crew’s lives. The GM isn’t sure. How cold-hearted is this veteran hunter? She’s stared giant demons in the eye without flinching... is there anything human left inside her? The GM makes a 2d fortune roll for “human feelings” to see if a spark of compassion remains in heart. If so, maybe one of the PCs can roll to Consort, Sway, or Command her to stand down.

## Gathering Information

The flow of information from the GM to the players about the fictional world is very important in a roleplaying game. By default, the GM tells the players what their characters perceive, suspect, and intuit. But there’s just too much going on to say everything—it would take forever and be boring, too. The players have a tool at their disposal to more fully investigate the fictional world.

When you want to know something specific about the fictional world, your character can gather information. The GM will ask you how your character gathers the info (or how they learned it in the past).

If it’s common knowledge, the GM will simply answer your questions. If there’s an obstacle to the discovery of the answer, an action roll is called for. If it’s not common knowledge but there’s no obstacle, a simple fortune roll determines the quality of the information you gather.

_For instance, if you decide to grab Avrick the powder dealer and Command him to talk, you could ask, “Where does he get his supply?” Avrick isn’t tough enough to stand up to you, so it’s a simple fortune roll to see how much he talks. On a 1-3, he admits that he gets his supply from the Red Sashes. On a 4/5, he also tells you that he works for the Sashes because they forced him to. On a 6, he also reveals the time and place that he picks up the stash each week. On a critical, he’ll even tell you a secret that he discovered: the Sashes get the drugs from diplomatic couriers from Iruvia._

Each attempt to gather information takes time. If the situation allows, you can try again if you don’t initially get all the info that you want. But often, the opportunity is fleeting, and you’ll only get one chance to roll for that particular question.

Some example questions are on the bottom of the character sheet. The GM always answers honestly, but with a level of detail according to the level of effect.

The most common gather information actions are Studying the situation, to reveal or anticipate what’s going on, or a person, to understand what they intend to do or what they’re really thinking.

Sometimes, you’ll have to maneuver yourself into position before you can gather information. For example, you might have to Sneak to a good hiding place first and then Study the cultists when they perform their dark ritual.

**Investigation**

Some questions are too complex to answer immediately with a single gather information roll. For instance, you might want to discover the routes smuggler ships take their contraband through an asteroid field. In these cases, the GM will tell you to start a long-term project that you work on during [Downtime](#downtime).

You track the investigation project using a progress clock. Once the clock is filled, you have the evidence you need to ask several questions about the subject of your investigation as if you had great effect.

**Examples & Questions**

- You might Attune to the mystic energies to see echoes of recent spirit activity. _Have any new ghosts been here? How can I find the spirit well that’s calling to them? What should I be worried about?_
- You might Command a local barkeep to tell you what he knows about the secret meetings held in his back room. _What’s really going on here? What’s he really feeling about this? Is he part of this secret group?_
- You might Consort with a well-connected friend to learn secrets about an enemy, rival, or potential ally. _What do they intend to do? What might I suspect about their motives? How can I discover leverage to manipulate them?_
- You might Doctor a biological creature to determine its weakness, or some essential element of its makeup. _What sort of food is safe for him to eat? What's the secret to her unnatural strength?_
- You might Hack a computer system to reveal secrets only accessible to authorized users, or to use remote sensing tools normally closed to you. _How many users have logged meetings with this Captain? What do the security cameras report on the other side of this door?_
- You might Study ancient and obscure books to discover an arcane secret. _How can I disable the runes of warding? Will anyone sense if they’re disabled?_
- Or you might Study a person to read their intentions and feelings. _What are they really feeling? How could I get them to trust me?_
- You might Study a target to case it for a heist. _What’s a good point of infiltration? What’s the danger here?_
- You might Sway Lord Strangford at a party so he divulges his future plans. _What does he intend to do? How can I get him to think I might be a good partner in this venture?_
- Or you might Sway Strangford’s bodyguard to confide in you about recent events. _Where has he been lately? Who’s he been meeting with?_

## PC VS. PC

Situations may arise in play in which two or more PCs come into conflict. How do you deal with this? In general, the rules for PC vs. PC action are the same as the rules for PC vs. NPC action. It’s still action rolls, resistance rolls, fortune rolls; effects and consequences; and resolution into a new situation. But it’s a good idea to follow some guidelines when it comes to PC vs. PC conflict.

1. Pause the game. When a PC comes into conflict with another PC, pause the game. It’s a time-out in the fictional space, while the players talk things through. Don’t be in a big rush to roll dice. Slow everything way down. This isn’t a “who talks first wins” situation (and especially not “who talks more or loudest”).

_“Who goes first?” is sometimes the question players fixate on, especially if things are about to get violent. Usually, the answer is clear from the situation: someone has the initiative and someone else is reacting. If it isn’t clear, you can make fortune rolls—each player rolls an action rating and you compare the results._

2. Agree to the resolution methods. Talk it through, figure out the rolls, and discuss the consequences at stake. Don’t try to resolve the situation until everyone agrees to the methods you’re about to use. If you have an objection or an alternate idea, speak up! If the players can’t agree to a method, then you’re deadlocked. You can’t proceed without everyone’s consent, so this conflict just isn’t going to happen. Maybe the PCs get in each other’s faces and act like they’re going to tangle, but then, nope... it fizzles and they back off. This happens in fiction a lot, and it’s okay if it happens in the game.

_It’s a good idea to ask each other questions to help establish the resolution, rather than trying to impose your will. You might ask, “Can Vale be Swayed here? What would it take?” or, “Is Jewel within reach if I draw my sword now and attack?” or, “How vicious is Cyr going to be? Do you really want to hurt me?”_

3. Abide by the results. Once you’ve agreed to the methods, then follow them through and abide by the outcomes. You can roll resistance to avoid bad results, as usual, so don’t try to weasel out of it some other way if things don’t turn out the way you hoped.

Note that this is not a “player vs. player” system. When characters come into conflict, the players must still collaborate and make judgment calls together, as usual. Conflicts between players are outside the scope of the game; they can’t be resolved with the dice rolls and mechanics of Blades in the Dark. If the players—not their characters—are in conflict, you’ll have to work it out using social methods, then return to the game when it’s resolved. Don’t try to use the game as a way to dodge or replace a normal social interaction to resolve person- to-person conflict.


## Coin & Stash

**Coin**

TODO: Make this more scifi

Coin is an abstract measure of cash and liquid assets. The term is Akorosian slang from the days of the old Imperial treasury, which minted special bank coins of solid gold—each one valuable enough to cover a major transaction. “Flashing a coin” was considered an ostentatious display of wealth. These days, everyone uses small silver pieces for currency, commonly called “slugs” or “scales.”

The few silver pieces the PCs use in their daily lives are not tracked. If a scoundrel wants to toss a few silver around to achieve a small goal (bribe a doorman), use the PC’s lifestyle quality for a fortune roll (see Stash, at right).

monetary values

- 1 coin: A full purse of silver pieces. A week’s wages.
- 2 coin: A fine weapon. A weekly income for a small business. A fine piece of art. A set of luxury clothes.
- 4 coin: A satchel full of silver. A month’s wages.
- 6 coin: An exquisite jewel. A heavy burden of silver pieces.
- 8 coin: A good monthly take for a small business. A small safe full of coins and valuables. A very rare luxury commodity.
- 10 coin: Liquidating a significant asset—a carriage and goats, a horse, a deed to a small property.
More than 4 coin is an impractical amount to keep lying around. You must spend the excess or put it in your stash (see below). A crew can also store 4 coin in their lair, by default. If they upgrade to a vault, they can expand their stores to 8 and then 16 coin. Any coin beyond their limit must be spent as soon as possible (typically before the next score) or distributed among the crew members.

One unit of coin in silver pieces or other bulk currency takes up one item slot for your load when carried.

coin use

- Spend 1 coin to get an additional activity during [downtime](#downtime).
- Spend 1 coin to increase the result level of a [downtime activity roll](#downtime).
- Spend coin to avoid certain [crew entanglements](#entanglements).
- Put coin in your character’s stash to improve their lifestyle and circumstances when they retire. See the next section.
- Spend coin when you advance your crew’s [Tier](#tier).
**Stash & Retirement**

When you mark your character’s final trauma and they retire, the amount of coin they’ve managed to stash away determines their fate. Your stash tracker is on your character sheet.

- Stash 0-10: Poor soul. You end up in the gutter, awash in vice and misery.
- Stash 11-20: Meager. A tiny hovel that you can call your own.
- Stash 21-39: Modest. A simple home or apartment, with some small comforts. You might operate a tavern or small business.
- Stash 40: Fine. A well-appointed home or apartment, claiming a few luxuries. You might operate a medium business.
In addition, each full row of stash (10 coins) indicates the quality level of the scoundrel’s lifestyle, from zero (street life) to four (luxury).

_Canter Haig is a scoundrel who cares a great deal about his sartorial swagger, and Adam, his player, often describes Canter as modeling the most stylish and outrageous fashion to impress his peers. But he’s just some street scoundrel, right? How impressive is his six-collared coat, really? The GM can call for a fortune roll using Canter’s lifestyle level as the dice pool to find out how much impact the attire has._

_Cross wants some alone-time with a prospective new friend, but he can’t take them back to the hidden lair where he lives, so what to do? Ryan, Cross’s player, says he wants to rent a nice room for the evening, so the GM asks for a fortune roll using Cross’s lifestyle rating to see what quality of room Cross can manage._

**Removing Coin From Your Stash**

If you want to pull coin out of your stash, you may do so, at a cost. Your character sells off some of their assets and investments in order to get some quick cash. For every 2 stash removed, you get 1 coin in cash.


## The Faction Game

_The Reach is a star system isolated, torn from time or space and out of contact with any other civilization. Every faction preys on others to survive, and control of the Gate or the planets can make or break entire civilizations. Alliances are fleeting, vendettas are bloody. Into this turmoil of war and revolution your crew is thrown together by circumstance. Will you be crushed, or will you rise up?_


### Tier

Take a look at the [factions](#factions). Each notable faction of the system is ranked by Tier—a measure of wealth, influence, and scale, as well as being classified by type. At the highest level are the Tier V and VI factions, the true powers of the system. Your crew begins at Tier 0.

You’ll use your Tier rating to roll dice when you acquire an asset, as well as for any fortune roll for which your crew’s overall power level and influence is the primary trait. Most importantly, your Tier determines the quality level of your items as well as the quality and scale of the gangs your crew employs—and thereby what size of enemy you can expect to handle.

**Gang Scale By Tier**

- Tier V: Massive (80 people)
- Tier IV: Huge (40 people)
- Tier III: Large (20 people)
- Tier II: Medium (12 people)
- Tier I: Small (3-6 people)
- Tier 0: 1 or 2 people

### Hold

On the faction ladder next to the Tier numbers is a letter indicating the strength of each faction’s hold. Hold represents how well a faction can maintain their current position on the ladder. W indicates weak hold. S indicates strong hold. Your crew begins with strong hold at Tier 0.

**Reducing Hold**

You may perform an operation specifically to reduce the hold of another faction, if you know how they’re vulnerable. If the operation succeeds, the target faction loses 1 level of hold. If their hold is weak and it drops, the faction loses 1 Tier and stays weak.

When a faction is at [war](#war), it temporarily loses 1 hold.

Your crew can lose hold, too, following the same rules above. If your crew is Tier 0, with weak hold, and you lose hold for any reason, your lair comes under threat by your enemies or by a faction seeking to profit from your misfortune.


### Type

In a star system with multiple planets, a smattering of space stations, and billions of people, there are many ways to band together.

- The largest and slowest-moving is a Civilization: a group so large they could conceivably aim to hold dominion over the entire Reach. Interstellar empires, megacorporations, and terrestrial nations are Civilizations.
- The next largest are Organizations, groups which you could conceivably meet anywhere, but who don't control any meaningful territory. Wide-spread criminal organizations, powerful religions, and political collectives are Organizations.
- Smaller still are Locales, a single community of people gathered together. An independent space station, a ming colony, or a town is a Locale.
- Those who operate as freelancers, taking jobs to scrape by in an unfair world are Crews. A spaceship full of mercenaries, a smuggling crew based out of a remote space station, and a protection racket on the surface of a planet are Crews.

### Development

To move up the ladder and develop your crew, you need rep. Rep is a measure of clout and renown. When you accrue enough rep, the other factions take you more seriously and you attract the support needed to develop and grow.

When you complete a score, your crew earns 2 rep. If the target of the score is higher Tier than your crew, you get +1 rep per Tier higher. If the target of the score is lower Tier, you get -1 rep per Tier lower (minimum zero).

You need 12 rep to fill the rep tracker on your crew sheet. When you fill the tracker, do one of the following:

- If your hold is weak, it becomes strong. Reset your rep to zero.
- If your hold is strong, you can pay to increase your crew Tier by one. This costs coin equal to your new Tier x 8. As long as your rep tracker is full, you don’t earn new rep (12 is the max). Once you pay and increase your Tier, reset your rep to zero and reduce your hold to weak.

### Turf

TODO: turf equivalent mechanic


### Faction Status

Your crew’s status with each faction indicates how well you are liked or hated. Status is rated from -3 to +3, with zero (neutral) being the default starting status. You track your status with each faction on the faction sheet.

When you create your crew, you assign some positive and negative status ratings to reflect recent history. The ratings will then change over time based on your actions in play.

**Faction Status Changes**

When you execute an operation, you gain -1 or -2 status with factions that are hurt by your actions. You may also gain +1 status with a faction that your operation helps. (If you keep your operation completely quiet then your status doesn’t change.) Your status may also change if you do a favor for a faction or if you refuse one of their demands.

For the smallest factions, Crews and Locales, one status corresponds to one opinion. They are small and you can present a great threat to them, or a great help. For Organizations, every two status points correspond to one opinion. Being more distributed, it takes more effort to change their mind. For Civilizations, every three status points correspond to one opinion. It takes a lot to influence interplanetary governments or spacefaring megacorporations.

**Faction Opinion Levels**

- +3: Allies. This faction will help you even if it’s not in their best interest to do so. They expect you to do the same for them.
- +2: Friendly. This faction will help you if it doesn’t create serious problems for them. They expect you to do the same.
- +1: Helpful. This faction will help you if it causes no problems or significant cost for them. They expect the same from you.
- 0: Neutral
- -1: Interfering. This faction will look for opportunities to cause trouble for you (or profit from your misfortune) as long as it causes no problems or significant cost for them. They expect the same from you.
- -2: Hostile. This faction will look for opportunities to hurt you as long as it doesn’t create serious problems for them. They expect you to do the same, and take precautions against you.
- -3: War. This faction will go out of its way to hurt you even if it’s not in their best interest to do so. They expect you to do the same, and take precautions against you. When you’re at war with any number of factions, your crew suffers +1 heat from scores, temporarily loses 1 hold, and PCs get only one downtime action rather than two. You can end a war by eliminating your enemy or by negotiating a mutual agreement to establish a new status rating.
If your crew has weak hold when you go to war, the temporary loss of hold causes you to lose one Tier. When the war is over, restore your crew’s Tier back to its pre-war level.


### Claims

## Advancement


### PC Advancement

TODO: Finalize 'class character'

Each player keeps track of the experience points (xp) that their character earns.

During the game session, mark xp:

- When you make a desperate action roll. Mark 1 xp in the attribute for the action you rolled. For example, if you roll a desperate Brawl action, you mark xp in Body . When you roll in a group action that’s desperate, you also mark xp.
At the end of the session, review the xp triggers on your character sheet. For each one, mark 1 xp if it happened at all, or mark 2 xp if it happened a lot during the session. The xp triggers are:

- Your playbook-specific xp trigger. For example, (TODO) the Cutter’s is “Address a challenge with violence or coercion.” To “address a challenge,” your character should attempt to overcome a tough obstacle or threat. It doesn’t matter if the action is successful or not. You get xp either way.
- You expressed your [beliefs,](#beliefs) drives, origin, or background. Your character’s drives are yours to define, session to session. Feel free to tell the group about them when you mark xp.
- You struggled with issues from your vice or traumas. Mark xp for this if your vice tempted you to some bad action or if a trauma condition caused you trouble. Simply indulging your vice doesn’t count as struggling with it (unless you overindulge, see [Vice](#vice)).
You may mark end-of-session xp on any xp tracks you want (any attribute or your playbook xp track).

When you fill an xp track, clear all the marks and take an advance. When you take an advance from your playbook track, you may choose an additional special ability. When you take an advance from an attribute, you may add an additional action dot to one of the actions under that attribute.

TODO

_Nadja is playing a Hound. At the end of the session, she reviews her xp triggers and tells the group how much xp she’s getting. She rolled two desperate Hunt actions during the session, so she marked 2 xp on her Insight xp track. She addressed several challenges with tracking or violence, so she marks 2 xp for that. She expressed her Iruvian heritage many times when dealing with the Red Sashes, so she takes 2 xp for that. She also showcased her character’s beliefs, but 2 xp is the maximum for that category, so she doesn’t get any more. She didn’t struggle with her vice or traumas, so no xp there. That’s 4 xp at the end of the session. She decides to put it all in her Insight xp track. This fills the track, so she adds a new action dot in Hunt._

You can also earn xp by training during downtime. When you train, mark xp in one of your attributes or in your playbook. A given xp track can be trained only once per downtime phase. See [Training](#training).


### Crew Advancement

At the end of the session, review the crew xp triggers and mark 1 crew xp for each item that occurred during the session. If an item occurred multiple times or in a major way, mark 2 crew xp for it. The crew xp triggers are:

- Your crew-specific xp trigger. For example, the (TODO) Smugglers’ is “Execute a smuggling operation or acquire new clients or contraband sources.” If the crew successfully completed an operation from this trigger, mark xp.
- Contend with challenges above your current station. If you tangled with higher Tiers or more dangerous opposition, mark xp for this.
- Bolster your crew’s reputation or develop a new one. Review your crew’s reputation. Did you do anything to promote it? Also mark xp if you developed a new reputation for the crew.
- Express the goals, drives, inner conflict, or essential nature of the crew. This one is very broad! Essentially, did anything happen that highlighted the specific elements that make your crew unique?
When you fill your crew advancement tracker, clear the marks and take a new special ability or mark two crew upgrade boxes.

TODO

_For example, when a crew of Assassins earns a crew advance, they could take a new special ability, like Predators. Or they could mark two upgrades, like Ironhook Contacts and Resolve Training._

Say how you’ve obtained this new ability or upgrades for the crew. Where did it come from? How does it become a new part of the crew?

**Profits**

Every time the crew advances, each PC gets +1 stash (+2 per crew Tier) as a bonus payment, to represent profits generated by the crew as they’ve been operating.


### Changing Playbooks or Crew Type

A player might want to change their character to a different playbook (a Brawler becomes a Pilot), or the group may decide to shift their crew to a new type (Dealers become Smugglers). There are two ways to do this.

- The change represents a “rebuild” of the character or crew. For instance, if the PC was created as an Assassin, but after a couple sessions, the player realizes that the Bruiser playbook is a better fit for what they want to play. In this case, re-create the character or crew anew using the new sheet, keeping the same number of advances already earned.
- The change represents growth into something new, leaving the old life behind. In this case, transfer the action ratings of a PC or the upgrades of a crew to the new sheet (keeping the same total number of action dots or upgrades; you don’t get the “free” elements of the new playbook as extra advancement). You may keep some of the special abilities already earned as Veteran advances, as well as the old playbook's starting ability (in place of the new one.) A crew might also keep their [claims](#claims)—assess each one to see if it makes sense in the fiction to keep it with the new crew type.

# Characters

TODO: flavor here


### Scoundrels

TODO

Every player character in _Beyond Reach_ is a daring criminal of the underworld, known in common parlance as a scoundrel. Scoundrels are familiar with all of the various feats of skulduggery represented by the actions of the game. They’re all able to Skirmish in a knife-fight, Prowl in the shadows, Attune to strange energy, Consort with contacts for information, and so on.

Because of the way the dice system works, every scoundrel can roll at least 2d for any action in the game (+1d from pushing or a Devil’s Bargain, and a +1d assist from a teammate). A roll of 2d is pretty good, statistically—a 75% chance of success. This means that all of the “zero rating” actions on your character sheet don’t actually represent deficiencies or gaps of skill; they indicate the actions for which your character is likely to burn stress and rely on teamwork. As a scoundrel of the Dusk, with your crew at your back, you can attempt almost anything.

Of course, you’ll also have your specializations and skills, the qualities that make your character uniquely effective in the criminal world. You might want the ability to compel obedience from ghosts and channel electroplasmic energy through your body, or maybe you want to manipulate the network of the underworld to your advantage and see danger before it strikes, or maybe you just want to be the deadliest fighter with a blade. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to create your own unique scoundrel and choose the abilities that suit the style of play you prefer.


## Character Creation

**Choose a Playbook:**

A playbook is what we call the sheet with all the specific rules to play a certain character type in _Beyond the Reach._ Rather than a general “scoundrel” sheet, the game has eight customized playbooks. By choosing a playbook, you’re choosing which type of scoundrel your character is. The playbooks are:

- Assassins: Assassins deal in deliberate, targeted violence and evasion. Play an Assassin if you want to strike from the shadows.
- Bruisers: Bruisers are sturdy and dependable, focused on winning fights and protecting their allies. Play a Bruiser if you want to take and deal powerful blows.
- Diplomat: Diplomats are silver-tongued operatives who can convince and cajole. Play a Diplomat if you want to assist your teammates and interface with other factions.
- Gearhead: Gearheads are comfortable with machines, both in crafting during downtime and on-the-spot invention. Play a Gearhead if you want to be creative with the physical world.
- Pilot: Pilots are dare-devils who constantly skirt the edge of the possible. Play a Pilot if you want to ride the line between life and death as you act through your vehicle.
- Medic: Medics are intellectual and effective with biological problems, both to heal and hurt. Play a Medic if you want to patch up your friends or use your expertise for your own ends.
- Mystic: Mystics are connected to the magic energy that flows through the world. Play a Mystic if you want to weave magic or commune with the spirits around you.
- Slicer: Slicers understand the 'net and see the cracks in complex systems. Play a Slicer if you want to break into computers or slip past defenses undetected.
When you choose a playbook, you’re choosing a set of special abilities (which give your character ways to break the rules in various ways) and a set of xp triggers (which determine how you earn experience for character advancement). But every playbook represents a scoundrel at heart. The Bruiser has special abilities related to combat, but that doesn’t mean they’re “the fighter” of the game. Any character type can fight well. Think of your playbook as an area of focus and preference, but not a unique skill set.

This is why we call them “playbooks” rather than “character classes” or “archetypes.” You’re selecting the set of initial action ratings and special abilities that your character has access to—but you’re not defining their immutable essence or true nature. Your character will grow and change over time; who they become is part of the fun of playing the game. Part of your character's initial reputation will come from their playbook choice; people will react differently to a Medic versus an Assassin.

Once you’ve chosen your playbook, follow the steps below to complete your character.

**Choose an Origin:**

Your character's origin describes who and what they are. Is your character organic or inorganic? What sort of species do they hail from? Additionally, is your character from the Reach or a newcomer? Write a short description in your playbook.

**Choose a Background:**

Your character’s background describes what they did before they joined the crew. Choose one of the general background options from the list on your playbook, then write a detail about it that’s specific to your character. For example, you could choose Labor, and then write Exotic engine mechanic. Or you might choose Noble and write Disgraced Heiress. See more examples below.

- Academic: A scholar, a professor or student from a univeristy, a philosopher or journalist, etc.
- Labor: A scrapper, a ship-builder, a dockworker, a bartender, a janitor, etc.
- Law: A lawyer, guard, Imperial Peacekeeper, Independent Sheriff, etc.
- Trade: A shopkeeper, a merchant, a skilled crafts-person, a shipping agent, etc
- Military: An Imperial soldier, a mercenary, an intelligence operative, a strategist, a training instructor, etc.
- Noble: A dilettante, a courtier, the scion of a fallen house, etc.
- Underworld: A street urchin, gang member, young thug, or other outcast who grew up on the streets.
**Assign Four Action Dots**

Your playbook begins with three action dots already placed. You get to add four more dots (so you’ll have seven total). At the start of the game, no action rating may have more than two dots (unless a special ability tells you otherwise). Brief descriptions of all the actions follow, on pages 58 and 59. Assign your four dots like this:

- Put one dot in any action that you feel reflects your character’s origin.
- Put one dot in any action that you feel reflects your character’s background.
- Assign two more dots anywhere you please (max rating is 2, remember).
**Your First Special Ability**

Each playbook comes with a "Starter" ability unique to that book. Mark it off, it's free!

**Choosing Your Connections**

Even if your character is a relatively new arrival, presumably they didn't spawn fresh out of the ether to join the crew. Work with your GM to establish a list of five NPCs your character knows and can call on in some way (though there's no guarantee they'll answer.) Designate one of these people your close friend (denoted with an up arrow) and one your rival (denoted with a down arrow.) Each game of _Beyond the Reach_ can set its own story and setting, so it's up to your group how to pull in these characters.

**Choose Your Vice**

Every scoundrel is in thrall to some vice or another, which they indulge to deal with stress. Choose a vice from the list, and describe it on the line above with the specific details and the name and location of your vice purveyor in the city. For example, you might choose Gambling, then write Blackjack, Tyl Casino. You can create a vice purveyor or ask the GM to tell you about a couple likely options for your vice.

- Faith: You’re dedicated to an unseen power, forgotten god, ancestor, etc.
- Gambling: You crave games of chance, betting on sporting events, etc.
- Luxury: Expensive or ostentatious displays of opulence.
- Obligation: You’re devoted to a family, a cause, an organization, a charity, etc.
- Pleasure: Gratification from lovers, food, drink, drugs, art, theater, etc.
- Stupor: You seek oblivion in the abuse of drugs, drinking to excess, getting beaten to a pulp in illicit fighting rings, etc.
- Weird: You experiment with strange essences, consort with rogue spirits, observe bizarre rituals or taboos, etc.
**Record Your Name, Alias, & Look**

Choose a name for your character, maybe making use of a setting-specific name generator. If your character uses an alias or nickname in the underworld, make a note of it. Record a few evocative words that describe your character’s look.

**Review Your Details**

TODO: XP triggers

Take a look at the details on your character sheet, especially the experience triggers for your playbook (like “Earn xp when you address a challenge with knowledge or arcane power,” for example) and the special items available to a character of your type (like the Gearhead’s engineer goggles, for example). You begin with access to all of the items on your sheet, so don’t worry about picking specific things—you’ll decide what your character is carrying later on, when you’re on the job (see [Loadout](#loadout)).

That’s it! Your character is ready for play. When you start the first session, the GM will ask you some questions about who you are, your outlook, or some past events. If you don’t know the answers, make some up. Or ask the other players for ideas.


### Character Creation Summary

1. Choose a playbook. Your playbook represents your character’s reputation in the underworld, their special abilities, and how they advance.

2. Choose an origin. Detail your choice with a note about your early life. For example, Nanomachine cyborg born to slavery.

3. Choose a background. Detail your choice with your specific history. For example, Disgraced deep-space pilot.

4. Assign four action dots. No action may begin with a rating higher than 2 during character creation. (After creation, action ratings may advance up to 3. When you unlock the Mastery advance for your crew, you can advance actions up to rating 4.)

5. Read over your playbook's starting ability.

6. Choose your character's contacts. Mark the one who is a close friend, long-time ally, family relation, or lover (the upward-pointing triangle). Mark one who is a rival, enemy, scorned lover, betrayed partner, etc. (the downward-pointing triangle).

7. Choose your vice. Pick your preferred type of vice, detail it with a short description and indicate the name and location of your vice purveyor.

8. Record your name, alias, and look. Choose a name, an alias (if you use one), and jot down a few words to describe your look. Examples

**Loadout**

You have access to all of the items on your character sheet. For each operation, decide what your character’s load will be. During the operation, you may say that your character has an item on hand by checking the box for the item you want to use—up to a number of items equal to your chosen load. Your load also determines your movement speed and conspicuousness:

- 1-3 load: Light. You’re faster, less conspicuous; you blend in with citizens.
- 4/5 load: Normal. You look like a scoundrel, ready for trouble.
- 6 load: Heavy. You’re slower. You look like an operative on a mission.
- 7-9 load: Encumbered. You’re overburdened and can’t do anything except move very slowly.
Some special abilities (like the Bruiser’s Mule ability or a Demon’s incredible strength) increase the load limits.

Some items count as two items for load (they have two connected boxes). Items in italics don’t count toward your load.

You don’t need to select specific items now. Review your personal items and the standard item descriptions on page 88. TODO item descriptions, character items

As you can see, many actions overlap with others. This is by design. As a player, you get to choose which action you roll, by saying what your character does. Can you try to Wreck someone during a fight? Sure! The GM tells you the position and effect level of your action in this circumstance. As it says, Brawling might be better (less risky or more effective), depending on the situation at hand (sometimes it won’t be better).
